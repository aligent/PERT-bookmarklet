        <summary>What is PERT?</summary>
        <p>
          PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) calculates a weighted
          average as the PERT estimate by using the formula
        </p>
        <p>Pert Estimate = (Optimistic + (4 X Most Likely) + Pessimistic)/6</p>
        <h3>Optimistic Estimate</h3>
        <p>Estimate for all favourable conditions with no risks or changes.</p>
        <p>
          The Optimistic Estimate is the “best-case” and thus shortest duration,
          or lowest cost, to complete the work.
        </p>
        <h3>Most Likely Estimate</h3>
        <p>
          Estimate for both favourable and unfavourable conditions, with some
          risks occurring.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name is accurate in the estimate is based on changes, but ones
          that have been planned for and can be mitigated. The Most Likely
          estimate captures the highest likelihood of completing the work in the
          given duration or cost.
        </p>
        <h3>Pessimistic Estimate</h3>
        <p>
          Estimate for all unfavourable conditions with all negative risks
          occurring and no mitigation of negative risks
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the opposite of the Optimistic estimate in concept. The
          Pessimistic Estimate is the “worst-case” and thus longest duration, or
          highest cost, to complete the work.
