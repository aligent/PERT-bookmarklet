        <summary>What is PERT?</summary>
        <p>
          PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) calculates a weighted
          average as the PERT estimate by using the formula
        </p>
        <figure>
          <p>Pert Estimate = (Optimistic + (4 X Likely) + Pessimistic)/6</p>
        </figure>
        <h3>Optimistic Estimate</h3>
        <p>Estimate for all favourable conditions with no risks or changes.</p>
        <p>
          The Optimistic Estimate is the “best-case” and thus shortest duration,
          or lowest cost, to complete the work.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The fastest time you can complete an activity. This assumes that
              all the necessary resources have been put in place and nothing
              unexpected occurs. This estimate is hard to achieve most of the
              time because projects are expected to face some challenges.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

        <h3>Likely Estimate</h3>
        <p>
          Estimate for both favourable and unfavourable conditions, with some
          risks occurring.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name is accurate in the estimate is based on changes, but ones
          that have been planned for and can be mitigated. The Most Likely
          estimate captures the highest likelihood of completing the work in the
          given duration or cost.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The most likely figure if there aren't any significant issues, but
              also not the best optimistic case. A realistic estimate. If you
              were asked for a quick time estimate this might be the figure you
              would come up with.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <figcaption>—Kelly Birch</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Pessimistic Estimate</h3>
        <p>
          Estimate for all unfavourable conditions with all negative risks
          occurring and no mitigation of negative risks
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the opposite of the Optimistic estimate in concept. The
          Pessimistic Estimate is the “worst-case” and thus longest duration, or
          highest cost, to complete the work.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              This refers to the maximum time needed to complete an activity. It
              assumes and factors in all the negative things that may affect an
              activity. Most project teams assume resource unavailability and
              rework when deriving this estimate.
            </p>
